SoundEffectManager is a simple singleton class that has the ability to open, load, cache, and play sounds. We are expanding its capabilities so keep an eye out for updates! Note that you must link against the AudioToolbox framework.

Usage.m is a file showing the usage of this class, this is NOT a proper class implementation.

There is no attribution required but is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for downloading,
