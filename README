SoundEffectManager is a simple singleton class that has the ability to open, load, cache, and play sounds. You can even vibrate the iPhone! Note that you must link against the AudioToolbox framework.

Usage.m is a file showing the usage of this class, this is NOT a proper class implementation.

There is no attribution required but is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for downloading,
